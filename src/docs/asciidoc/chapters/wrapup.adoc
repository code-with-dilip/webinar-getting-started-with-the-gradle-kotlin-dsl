[.notes]
--
* Upgrade Kotlin DSL version without upgrading Gradle?
** NO
* Distinguish build-logic and production Kotlin version
** build-logic: let Gradle handle the Kotlin version by using either the `kotlin-dsl` or `embedded-kotlin` plugin
** production code: business as usual
* Dependency Management
** You should refer to the Dependency Management documentation, webinar (they are using the Kotlin DSL)
** There's nothing special about the Kotlin DSL from a dependency management pov
