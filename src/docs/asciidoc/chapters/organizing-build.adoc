== Organizing build logic

=== Organizing build logic

* Understanding patterns for organizing build logic
* cross-configuration
* buildSrc
** extracting plugin to buildSrc
** build logic in buildSrc can be tested
* sharing build logic between builds

[.notes]
--
* build script logic can get unwieldy with conventions for Kotlin, Java, Scala, Groovy
** extract convention plugin into `buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/kotlin-conventions.gradle.kts`
*** setup `buildSrc` with `kotlin-dsl` plugin
*** move `kotlin("jvm")` plugin dependency to `buildSrc` / `dependencies`
*** create `src/main/kotlin/kotlin-conventions.gradle.kts`
*** plugins block with `kotlin("jvm")` plugin
*** move `compileKotlin` configuration into `kotlin-conventions`
*** simplify script plugin with type-safe accessor
*** `subprojects { apply(plugin = "kotlin-conventions") }` in root
*** demonstrate introducing warning and failing the build still works
* quick demo testing buildSrc
* sharing the plugin with a wider audience
** extract plugin to separate build
** to consume the plugin there are two options
*** include build
*** get the plugin from a repository
