== Authoring plugins

=== Sharing plugins with a wider audience

* Authoring DSLs that play well with both Kotlin, Groovy and other JVM languages
* Authoring plugins that can be used across Gradle versions
[.notes]
--
* consumer languages
** diverse build script DSLs
** diverse plugin implementation languages
** common denominator is static typing, applicable to every JVM language
*** it's always easier to use statically typed APIs from dynamically typed languages than the other way around
** prefer exposing statically typed APIs over dynamically or unityped APIs (e.g. using Object)
*** >> show 3 snippets: good (2 typed overloads, enum and string), bad (single Object taking function)
** prefer Gradle types over language specific types
*** e.g. org.gradle.api.Action<T> over groovy.lang.Closure or kotlin.Function
*** >> show 3 snippets: good, kotlin bad, groovy ugly
* consumer Gradle versions
** always start with the latest
*** in order to take advantage of all the goodness
*** apply best practices (see the guides)
** introduce cross-version testing
*** can be as simple as junit parameterized tests driving TestKit
*** add previous version to the test matrix incrementally
*** Fix as needed, stop when satisfied or overwhelmed
